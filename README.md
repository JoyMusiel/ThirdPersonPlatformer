# COSC 416 - Studio (Game Development) 3
The following project demonstrates a simple third-person platformer in Unity. This project utilizes and builds upon knowledge gained from prior studios including game management, UI elements, physics, the FreeLook camera, and input handling.

The player is able to move around with the WASD keys and jump (or double jump) with the space key, and they can increase their score by collecting coins scattered around the environment.

The 3D model asset used for the coins was made in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/).
